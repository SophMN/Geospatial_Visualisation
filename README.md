**Exploring the Geography of Disease**

Access to healthcare services, endemicity of disease vectors and infectious agents, culture and climate are some of the key geographical determinants of infections and diseases. It is important to visualise the geography of diseases to understand the gaps and features that influence disease burden and distribution. Integrating geospatial and public health data together not only tells a story, but also informs targeted strategies such as: enhancing healthcare access, social and behavioural change and environmental interventions to prevent and manage diseases.

**Distribution of Schistosomiasis in Selected Areas of  Kilifi**

Urogenital schistosomiasis is a water-borne neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium. In Kenya, it is an understudied disease despite its high burden in Coastal Kenya (Kilifi, Kwale, Tana River, Lamu and Mombasa). Below is a map showing the prevalence of schistosomiasis among women in selected areas of Kilifi County.
