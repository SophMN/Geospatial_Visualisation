**Exploring the Geography of Disease**

Access to healthcare services, endemicity of disease vectors and infectious agents, cultural practices and climate are some of the key geographical determinants of infections and diseases. It is important to visualise the geography of diseases to understand the gaps and features that influence disease burden and distribution. Integrating geospatial and public health data together not only tells a story but it also informs targeted strategies such as: healthcare access, social and behavioural change and environmental interventions to prevent and manage diseases.
